# Exercise 7: Form with custom hook

Now the custom hook holds all form logic and handles all data internally. Amazing! The custom hook returns its internal state, which can be changed with the handler functions. That way we keep all the control in one spot, and our form component clean.

- Just like exercise 6, every element should receive its corresponding value from the custom hook's state
- Add one or several handler functions (up to you) to read values generated by the onChange events and assign them to the respective properties inside the custom hook. You've done this before!
- Use the UserList component to render all newly added users to the DOM

- EASYBONUS: Add some form of validation (i.e. minimum age, names contain no numbers, checkbox is checked, etc.)
- MEGABONUS: Make the list of users persistent

## Tips

- Only make things accessible outside of the hook, which are necessary for the form to work
- The state is managed internally, handler functions handle how the state is changed
