# Exercise 5: Controlled Components

Add logic to the existing components by adding states and handler functions for them. Remember a controlled component has one source of truth, which is a corresponding state.

- Add a state for every `input` element, which holds the value the element is supposed to receive
- Add one or several handler functions (up to you) to read values generated by the onChange events and assign them to the respective states
- Use `console.log()` to display all the entered information when the form is submitted

- BONUS: Add some form of validation (i.e. min/max name length, minimum age, checkbox is checked, etc.)

## Tips

- Remember each element needs to receive the value of its respective state
- A `console.log()` in the right place might shed some light of what's going on
- The amount of functions you use to handle the user input is not correlated to the quality of the form!
