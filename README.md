# Exercise 6: Controlled Components in a form with a single useState

The state holds all the `userData` in a single object. Every time the user fires the `onChange` event on the input elements we want to add that to the existing state, remember _add_ without deleting other existing properties in the object (only the one that is supposed to receive the value).

- Just like exercise 5, every element receives its corresponding value from the state
- Add one or several handler functions (up to you) to read values generated by the `onChange` events and assign them to the respective properties
- Use `console.log()` to display all the entered information when the form is submitted

- DOUBLEBONUS: Add some form of validation (i.e. minimum age, names contain no numbers, checkbox is checked, etc.)

## Tips

- Again, here you can have several or just one function to handle the `onChange` events
- Remember each element needs to receive the correct value from the state's porperties
- A `console.log()` in the right place might shed some light of what's going on
- The amount of functions you use to handle the user input is not correlated to the quality of the form!
