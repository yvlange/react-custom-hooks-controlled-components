# Exercises: React - Controlled Components and Custom Hooks

This repository contains the next few exercises to practice your React knowledge. It is part 2 of https://github.com/namirsab/react-exercise-template

The repository contains 3 branches:

- `main`: just for this README and general resources
  And 3 branches, 1 per exercise:
- `5-controlled-components`
- `6-controlled-components-single-state`
- `7-custom-form-hook`

## Using the template

Use the template feature from GitHub to create a new repository under your profile.

**Make sure you tick the checkbox "Include all branches"**

Once you are set, you can clone your newly created repository and proceed.

## How to use it?

This project has been generated with [`create-react-app`](https://randomuser.me/documentation#results).

To install all the dependencies of the project before we start working, we run:

`npm install` or `npm i`

Once we are set, we have to run

`npm start`

to start the development server.

## Doing the exercises

Now that we have our project setup, all dependencies installed and the development server running, we can just switch between branches.
Each branch has its own README.md explaining what you need to achieve in the
exercise.
Just switch to a branch, work on the exercise, commit your changes to that branch and when you are done, you can switch to the next exercise.
